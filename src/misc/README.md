# Misc Scope
The misc scope contains a collection of scripts useful for interpreting the clean data before prompt generation.

Each data interpretation technique can be found in this scope in its own folder (e.g.: `word_cloud` contains the solution for generating a word cloud out of the data).

The `main.py` file orchestrates the execution of the components above by importing, setting up and calling the necessary logic from the mentioned folders.

The `outputs` folder contains all plots and images generated by the functions above.

# How to Run
1. Run `python main.py` in this folder

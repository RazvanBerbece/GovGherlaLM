# Source Files
The source codebase for the entire project and its comprising components can be found in the child folders in this folder.

- `data_preprocess/` holds the scripts used to preprocess (clean, format, etc.) the raw message data before using it to finetune the language model
- `misc/` holds the code for miscellaneous features developed as part of the project (for instance word clouds generated from the clean data)
- `model/` holds the codebase for the language model architecture, finetuning process and other necessary features

The Python codebase is formatted and indented using the `isort` and `black` packages.
